# ZigObjectSerializationTest

Simple test program to test how objects are
serialized into binary files, and how easy
it is to parse them back out.

The `output` directory is regenerated on each
execution to ensure it exists for the structures
to be written out to it.  I left documentation
as comments in the code to hopefully help
parse through it if needed.
